    <H2 id="hu">HULK</H2>
        <p class="lk">The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics.Created
            by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk 
            (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular 
            humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner,physically weak,
            socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as independent personalities and resenting of
            the other.
        </p>
        <p class="lk">Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an
            experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against 
            his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level
            of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the
            Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive 
            force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude,
            the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner's lover Betty Ross, his best friend Rick Jones, his 
            cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson.

            Captain America. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the fifth film in the
             Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Joe Johnston, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen

             the Tesseract as an energy source for world domination.
        </p>
        <p class="cp">The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield 
            that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced to the 
            peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near
             the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times.
             Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly 
             respected figure in his community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.
